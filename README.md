The initial idea was to generate data portraits and then print them as buttons for the students. We created a simple questionaire in order to spark discussions about what it is like to be a woman* in tech and STEM. 

*Please note that I use woman expansively beyond cis het women. The point of the conference is to let typically marginalized youth know that they have a place in cis het male dominated spaces in STEM.
